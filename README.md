**The Business Problem
Too many choices can overwhelm users.  If offered too many options, the user may not buy anything.  Streaming services like Spotify have massive catalogs.  Identifying the tracks a user might like and recommending the product they might like is crucicial for their business.**

**To solve this business problem we are going to create two playlists, a Popular Playlist which is then used to identify songs that are similar to a song a user already likes, giving the user a personalized playlist, or recommendations.**
